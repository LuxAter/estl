# Extended Standard Template Library

The extended template library is a set of classes and functions that are used
to improve or extend the standard library. For a guide on the usage of **ESTL**
see [Tutorial](docs/source/tutorial/index.md), and for detailed documentation of the API
see [API](docs/source/api/index.md).

All of the source code in **ESLT** is created to meet the standards of the
standard library. All of the documentation can be read for the documentation of
the entire library.
